## How to Play

- The LEDs light up in sequence. 
- Your goal is to press the pushbutton when the red led is on. 
- If you succeed you pass to the next level where the sequence goes faster. 
- If you fail you lose the game and return to level 1. 
- You win the game when you manage to pass all 10 levels.
- You can run a simulation of the game here: https://circuits.io/circuits/3616666-stop-it/
